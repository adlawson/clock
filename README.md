# Clock #

Clock based event emitting.

**Version:** *0.2.0*<br/>
**Build status:** [![Build Status][travis-status]][travis]


### About ###

This library was originally intended for other purposes but was deemed insufficient.

It isn't reliable enough for time-sensitive operations because it is merely built ontop of `setTimeout`.
It *is* still useful, however, for polling and other time independent applications.


### Usage ###

```js
var clock = require('clock');

clock.tock(function () {
    console.log('tock');
});

clock.tick(1000);

// tock
// tock
// tock
// ... (every 1000ms)
```


### Installation ###

This library isn't available from the NPM repository or any other
package manager, but you can still add it to your `package.json`

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "clock": "git://github.com/adlawson/clock.git#master"
  }
}
```
